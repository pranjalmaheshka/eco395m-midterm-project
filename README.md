  1. Introduction: what we studying? why are we studying it? 
     1. Academia focuses on research: but to what degree does quantity of publications weigh more than quality? 
     2. Tenure is the grand goal: security + freedom to conduct own research as they see fit. What stands in their way? 
     3. We see how economics professors at top universities in the US fare in this regard: what is their h-index score? How many of them have gotten tenure?
  2. Methodology: what did we do? how did we do it? 
     1. Put together a list of colleges
     2. Scraped webpages for names and job titles 
     3. Scraped google scholar for h-index and citation scores 
     4. Combined the two lists for further analysis 
  3. What do we find? 
     1. Average number/range of faculty members in each econ department
     2. How many Professors and Associate Professors on average in each Econ department? 
     3. h-index score: what is the lowest, what is the highest
     4. Number of citations: what is the lowest, what is the highest
     5. Which university seems to be faring better? 
     6. Scope for further analyis: gender, waterfall of citations (route of one paper citing another paper)
